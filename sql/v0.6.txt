To update to 0.6:
1) stop ckdb and ckpool
2) connect to postgres and delete the contents of all the tables except:
	users, idcontrol, version
   e.g. in psql to see all the table row counts: \i tables.sql
	and to delete the rows from a table: delete from auths;
3) in pgsql: update version set version='0.6';
4) rename all your ckdb20140*.log files using the src/relog.sh script
5) start ckdb
6) wait for ckdb to say it is ready - i.e. wait for it to reload all the
	ckdb20140*.log files
7) start ckpool

You can speed up step 6) if you don't care about losing the contents of the
DB forever: just go to the log directory and rename all the ckdb20140*.log
files something like: rename ".log" ".ignore" ckdb20140*.log
(or delete them)
